## Workshops
- Each workshop is worth 3%
- There are 10 workshops
- Workshops should take about 30 minutes for the average person (Usually would take 10-15 minutes for a student with Python experience if they test their code robustly)
- These contain content from the previous week of lectures / tutorials (Along with basic concepts from previous weeks)

## Assignments
- There are 3 assignments
- Each assignment is worth 15%
- Each assignment takes about 2 hours for the average person (Will take a student with Python experience 30mins)
- These contain content from each previous module, along with basic concepts from previous weeks

## Test
- The final test is worth 25%
- You have 2 hours to complete it from when it starts
- It contains content for all of the course
- Mostly based around problem solving rather than specfic knowledge of the Python language

## Other

- Beginner paper for people getting into programming. Focuses on programming knowledge more than Python knowledge towards the end of the course / the test. Beginners tended to struggle to realise this
- Massey CSIT had a discord server for course discussion which was really useful for a lot of students who needed help. Allowed many students (including myself) to help a lot of people and explain concepts.
- Really good introductory CS paper in my opinion
